Lab 01: A Bite Of Python
*************************************

As mentioned in a previous lecture, statistics is not a math course, but it relies on mathematical tools to Get Stuff Done. Doing math by hand is fun for about 10 minutes, but gets scary when there's literally a hundred or a thousand calculations to perform. It's time to let the computer do the work!

There are lots of ways to perform statistics computationally. Some common packages are R, MATLAB, or just plain old Excel. We're going to use Python, because it is an excellent language with which you can grow. It is beginner-friendly, with tons of resources online to help you along, yet very powerful for advanced programming. Python is used at large organizations such as Google, Yahoo!, CERN, and NASA, and in many famous applications including Youtube, Dropbox, Instagram, and Reddit. 

To get a gentle introduction to the language, complete the following exercises from *Learn Stats in 10,000 Hours*:

- `Exercise 0: Meet Python <http://www.jmillville.com/project/learnstats/ex0.html>`_
- `Exercise 1: How is the weather? <http://www.jmillville.com/project/learnstats/ex1.html>`_
- `Exercise 2: Lets go to the desert <http://www.jmillville.com/project/learnstats/ex2.html>`_

There is nothing to turn in for this lab.
