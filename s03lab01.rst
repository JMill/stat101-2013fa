First, work through these exercises:

- `Exercise 8: Making a Chart <http://www.jmillville.com/project/learnstats/ex8.html>`_
- `Exercise 9: Rowers and Coxswains <http://www.jmillville.com/project/learnstats/ex9.html>`_

Next, you will complete the exercises below. These will show you how to calculate and plot regression equations and the correlation coefficien, :math:`r`.

1. calculating the regression equation and correlation coefficient
#. making a scatter plot
#. making a scatter plot, including the regression line.
#. making a scatter plot w/ regression line and labels

There is nothing to turn in for this lab. 

Calculating the regression equation and :math:`r`
=======================================================

Create a new empty file in Canopy. Then type the following:

{{ ork.code('code/s03lab01-correlation-regression-calc.py|pyg') }}

Save the file as *lab03-correlation_regression.py* and run it.

You should see the following::

	{{ d['code/s03lab01-correlation-regression-calc.py|py']|indent(4) }}
