Descriptive Statistics
================================

Mean/Average
-----------------------

Sum of all numbers divided by the number of numbers, for example: The Mean of 2, 3, 4, 6, 7: :math:`\frac{2+3+4+6+7}{5} = 4.4`
	
Median
-------------

Half of the numbers lie above and half below this number, for example: The Median of 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 is 4 because half of the numbers (2 and 3) lie above and half (6 and 7) lie below this number.

Mode
-----------

Is the value most frequently observed, for example: The Mode of 2, 4, 2, 6, 2, 10, 4 is 2 because it is the most frequently observed. The Mode can also be Bimodal, for example: If a 4 was added to the above series, then the Mode would be (2 and 4).

Percentile (pth percentile)
--------------------------------------

The smallest number in a list that is at least as large as p% of the numbers in the list.
