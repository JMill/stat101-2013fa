Lab 04
*************************************

This lab is an introduction to basic probability and simulation. It is based on the introductory Python text by Vinay.

Complete the exercises below. These will show you how to simulate rolling a die and flipping a coin. (Yes, that sounds really dull, but all great journeys start with a first step, young padawan.)

- `Randomness and Rolling Dice <s04lab-1.html>`_
- `Running Coin Flipping Experiments  <s04lab-2.html>`_

There is nothing to turn in for this lab.
