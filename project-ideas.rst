Go to a local grocery store and collect these data for at least 25 breakfast cereals: cereal name; grams of sugar per serving; and the shelf location (bottom, middle, or top). If the store you select does not have at least 25 breakfast cereals, then collect data from another store, too.   Group the data by shelf location and use three boxplots to compare the sugar content by shelf location. [Observational data; using boxplots to summarize data. Also, use ANOVA test.  Use these data to estimate the simple regression model with price as the dependent variable and sugar as the explanatory variable.]

.. Estimate the average number of hours that students at this school sleep each day, including both nighttime sleep and daytime naps. Also estimate the percentage who have been up all night without sleeping at least once during the current semester. [Survey data; confidence intervals for quantitative and qualitative data; students sleep less than 8 hours and many have all-nighters; if done at the beginning and end of the term, the differences are as expected.]

Estimate and compare the average words per sentence in People, a local newspaper, and The New York Times. [Observational data; confidence interval with quantitative data; the order given is from fewest words to most;]

.. Estimate the percentage of the seniors at this university who regularly read a daily newspaper or news site (*no*, The Onion doesn’t count!), the percentage who can name the two U.S. senators from their home state, the percentage who are registered to vote, and the percentage who did vote. [Survey data; confidence intervals for qualitative data; far more students are registered and will vote than read a newspaper or can name their senators.]

Conduct a taste test of either Coke versus Pepsi or Diet Coke versus Diet Pepsi. Survey at least 50 randomly selected students who identify themselves beforehand as cola drinkers with a definite preference for one of the brands you are testing. Give each subject a cup of each cola that has been coded in a way known only to you. Calculate the fraction of your sample whose choice in the taste test matches the brand identified beforehand as their favorite. (Do not tell your subjects that this is a test of their ability to identify their favorite brand; tell them it is a test of which tastes better.) Determine the two-sided p-value for a test of the null hypothesis that there is a 0.5 probability that a cola drinker will choose his or her favorite brand. [Experimental data; hypothesis test using binomial model; most students prefer Coke, but neither group is very successful at identifying its favorite.] [Fun to do with your fraternity/sorority.]

Find five avid basketball players and ask each of them to shoot 100 free throws. Do not tell them the purpose of this exercise, which is to determine if a missed free throw is equally likely to bounce to the same or opposite side as their shooting hand. Use your data for each of these players to calculate the two-sided p-value for testing the null hypothesis that a missed free throw by this player is equally likely to bounce to either side. [Experimental data; hypothesis test using binomial model; coaches often say that the ball will bounce to shooting-hand side, but the data are unpersuasive.]

.. Ask 50 female students these four questions: Among female students at this college, is your height above average or below average? Is your weight above average or below average? Is your intelligence above average or below average? Is your physical attractiveness above average or below average? Ask 50 male students the same questions. Try to design a survey procedure that will ensure candid answers. For each gender and each question, test the null hypothesis that p = 0.5. [Survey data; hypothesis test using binomial model; most males think that they are above average.]

Young children who play sports are often separated by age. In 1991, for example, children born in 1984 might have been placed in a 7-year-old league while children born in 1983 were placed in an 8-year-old league. Someone born in January 1984 is eleven months older than someone born in December 1984. Because coaches give more attention and playing time to better players, children with early birth dates may have an advantage when they are young that cumulates over the years. To test this notion, look at a professional sport and see how many players have birth dates during the first six months of the year. [Observational data; hypothesis test using binomial model; seems to be true.]

.. University students are said to experience the Frosh 15 -- an average weight gain of 15 pounds during their first year at university. Test this folklore by asking at least 100 randomly selected students how much weight they gained or lost during their first year at university. Determine the two-sided p-value for testing the null hypothesis that the population mean is a 15-pound gain, and also determine a 95 percent confidence interval for the population mean. [Survey data; hypothesis test using t distribution; strongly rejected (is it a myth or do students misreport?).]

.. What percentage of the seniors at your college expect to be married within five years of graduation? What percentage expect to have children within five years of graduation? How many biological children do the seniors at your college expect to have during their lives? Do males and females differ in their answer to these questions? [Survey data; two-sample test; few expect to be married or have children within five years of graduation; males plan to have slightly more children; if possible, a comparison with alumni records is interesting.]

.. Ask a random sample of at least 50 students the following question: "During the school year, how many hours a week do you spend, on average, on school-related work -- for example, reading books, attending class, doing homework, and writing papers?" Ask a random sample of at least 10 professors this question: "During the school year, how many hours a week do you spend, on average, on school-related work -- for example, preparing lectures, teaching, grading, advising, serving on committees, and doing research?" Determine the p-value for a test at the 5 percent level of the null hypothesis that the two population means are equal. [Survey data; two-sample test; professors work twice as many hours as students.]

.. Ask randomly selected college students if they have had a serious romantic relationship in the past two years and, if so, to identify the month in which the most recent relationship began. When you have found 50 students who answer yes and can identify the month, make a chi-square test of the null hypothesis that each month is equally likely for the beginning of a romantic relationship. [Survey data; chi-square test; the start of each term is a popular time for romance.]

.. Ask 50 randomly selected students this question and then compare the male and female responses: "You have a coach ticket for a nonstop flight from Los Angeles to New York. Because the flight is overbooked, randomly selected passengers will be allowed to sit in open first-class seats. You are the first person selected. Would you rather sit next to: (a) the U.S. president; (b) the president's wife; or (c) Michael Jordan? [Survey data; chi-square test; females choose the president's wife, males the president.]

For each of the 50 states, calculate Bill Clinton's percentage of the total votes cast for the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates in 1992; do not include votes for other candidates. Do the same for the 1996 election. Is there a statistical relationship between these two sets of data? Are there any apparent outliers or anomalies? [Observational data; simple regression; extremely strong correlation with a few anomalies.]

Select an automobile model and year (at least three years old) that is of interest to you -- for example, a 1964 Land Rover Series II 88. Now find at least 30 of these cars that for sale (either from dealers or private owners) and record the odometer mileage (x) and asking price (y). As best you can, try to keep the cars as similar as possible. For example, ignore the car color, but do not mix together 4-cylinder and 6-cylinder cars or manual and automatic transmissions. Estimate the equation y = a + bx + e and summarize your results. [Observational data; simple linear regression; good fit with reasonable coefficients and interesting outliers.]

Pick a date and approximate time of day (for example, 10:00 in the morning on April 1) for scheduling nonstop flights from an airport near you to at least a dozen large U.S. cities. Determine the cost of a coach seat on each of these flights and the distance covered by each flight. Use your data to estimate a simple linear regression model with ticket cost the dependent variable and distance the explanatory variable. Are there any outliers? [Observational data; simple linear regression; good fit with reasonable coefficients and interesting outliers.]

Go to a local cemetery and compare the number and size of male and female tombstones. (Don’t go to the cemetery that is behind Scotus, as all of those folks are monks.  Consider walking up to the cemetery at St. Michael’s Basilica, just a couple minutes from campus.  Look up preexisting data on tombstone sizes for males/females and compare to your findings.

Choose two categories A and B based on either race or gender. Select 10 photographs of Category A people and 10 photographs of Category B people. These should not be pictures of celebrities or anyone else that your subjects will recognize. Show each subject 5 of the A pictures and 5 of the B pictures mixed together. Then show each subject all 20 pictures and ask them to select the 10 pictures that they had been shown previously. Compare the accuracy of subjects who are in Category A with the accuracy of subjects who are in Category B.

What fraction of The New York Times obituaries are for New Yorkers? Compare this with the fraction of obituaries in another major newspaper that are for local citizens; for example, The Los Angeles Times obituaries for Californians.

Use pre-race odds and post-race payoff data from the sports section of a newspaper to compare the average returns from betting on favorites and long shots in horse races.

Ask 50 randomly selected students if, aside from the obvious gender differences, they most resemble their biological mother or father. (Evolutionary psychologists suggest that people are more likely to say that a child resembles the father—apparently so that the father will be more likely to protect and care for the child.) For each gender, test the null hypothesis that p = 0.5.

Calculate the percentage change in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from the close on Thursday the 12th to the close on Friday the 13th for every Friday the 13th beginning in 1980. Is the average percentage change substantial? Determine the two-sided p value for a test of the null hypothesis that the mean percentage change is 0.
